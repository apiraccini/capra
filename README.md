# CAPRA - Context AI Powered Research Assistant üêë

Concept:
- search for articles on arxiv
- load each article into a corpus in chunks and obtain embeddings
- when questioned, provide context from the corpus answer using a llm model (RAG)

The pdf articles are processed using the model Nougat, first proposed in [Nougat: Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.13418) and accessible via [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) `transformers`, in order to extract the markdown text.

## Notes

- As of now, the arXiv API seems unreliable (maybe try a direct url GET call instead of using the Python wrapper for the API?).
- You will need to create your own `.env` file inside the root project directory, with you OpenAI API key inside.
- Will not make us of docker containers until Nougat is included with a stable version of `transformers` and a suitable solution for the arXiv API problem is found.
